Day 2

Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, 
then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. 
e.g. any two-digit number.

Example Input

39
Example Output

3 + 9 = 12

12

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. 
e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, 
the short person is usually more overweight.
The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) 
by the square of their height (in m):

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, 
months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, 
even the positions of the commas and full stops.
