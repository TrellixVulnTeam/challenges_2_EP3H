Day 3

Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43
43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5
29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, 
so the division is not clean.
The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. 
It gives you the remainder after a division.
e.g.
6 Ã· 2 = 3 with no remainder.
therefore: 6 % 2 = 0
5 Ã· 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.
therefore: 5 % 2 = 1
14 Ã· 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2.
therefore: 14 % 4 = 2
Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, 
even the positions of the commas and full stops.
Example Input 1
43
Example Output 1
This is an odd number.
Example Input 2
94
Example Output 2
This is an even number.
