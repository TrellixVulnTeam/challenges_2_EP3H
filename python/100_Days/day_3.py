Day 3

Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43
43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5
29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, 
so the division is not clean.
The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. 
It gives you the remainder after a division.
e.g.
6 Ã· 2 = 3 with no remainder.
therefore: 6 % 2 = 0
5 Ã· 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.
therefore: 5 % 2 = 1
14 Ã· 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2.
therefore: 14 % 4 = 2
Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, 
even the positions of the commas and full stops.
Example Input 1
43
Example Output 1
This is an odd number.
Example Input 2
94
Example Output 2
This is an even number.

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
Under 18.5 they are underweight
Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
Over 30 but below 35 they are obese

You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
To work out the love score between two people:
Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
"Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
"Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
"Your score is **z**."
